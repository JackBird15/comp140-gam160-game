Frite fight
http://shakethatbutton.com/frite-fight/
 
A two player game, where each player has different buttons placed on his body, each button, depending on where it is has a different
amount of points.
Your aim is to hit the buttons with the fright and get the most points at the end of the countdown.  (1 point for a hit on the arms, 2 on
the legs and 3 on the stomach). Swim noodles” (a swim noodle is a “french fry” (frite) in French
I find this interesting because it kind of fucntions like a kinnect type device, where you are the controller,
be able to interact with the second player in real life. Being able to physically hit them, rather than just in the game.

####Lemonade

Lemonade is a multiplayer game, where objects fall from the sky and you have to hit them with the water coming out from the pipes. 
The objective is to hit the most lemons falling from the sky. There are also cupcakes which fall, meaning you would have to avoid them, 
or else the game will reset. There is a nob on the side which controls the power of the ater, and you move the pipe to control 
the position of the pipe.
I find it interesting because it involves a fruit ninja type element, where you are trying to hit objects, and avoid others which are falling from the top of the screen. Even though the game is simple in It having two main controls, it still adds a difficulty aspect to it, as you will eventually hit a cupcake.

#####Unicornelia

This game involves the lpayer being a uniorn in an office job. It involves two components, a unicorn horn and some motion sensors. 
By using your unicorn horn you trigger the sensors to complete tasks in the office.
I like this game because its different to the other two I had seen. Where is involves a “dress up item” where which makes you look like
a unicorn.

###### Controller Design
The aesthetic for my controller will be a box, which is covered in an ocean sea type pattern which will hold the Arduino, protecting it
and not leaving any wires or components vulnerable. On top of the box will be a small shark head pointing out of it, this will have 
LED’s in its eyes, which will light up when a game mechanic is triggered. This will add a nice aesthetic to the controller, such as the
PS4 controller having the ability to light up when an event in the game is happening. As the player will be pushing the swimming
flippers quickly they may be more content looking at the controller rather than the game, making it useful to them. Coming off this will
be 2 small sized swimming flippers, which will have buttons underneath them. The buttons will act as the movement controls for the game.
By pushing the swimming flippers down, it will click the button underneath them, and make the player move forward. The flippers will be
attached to the box, making sure it’s one whole item and compact. It will also give it an angle for it to be able to push the swimming
flippers down with comfort and not feel like it has a mushy input.  

Here is a mock up of the controllers aesthetics
