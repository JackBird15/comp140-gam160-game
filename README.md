## Game Proposal - Jack Bird
For this project I will be producing a game which is based upon how fast the player is able to click the buttons. 
This game is a 2D game, based in the sea, where the player is swimming away from a shark. 
The shark will progressively get faster throughout the level meaning the player will have to push the buttons on the controller to keep swimming.

The aim of the game is to see how far the player can swim until the shark catches up with them.
To increase the difficulty of the game, I will be adding obstacles, to make it so you have to dive underneath to avoid the obstacle, hitting the obstacle will also decrease your speed.
Two buttons will control each leg, so when the player pushes down the left button the left leg will move and push the player forward and vice versa.
To be able to avoid an object both buttons would be pressed at the same time to dive.
The aim of the game is to see how far the player can get before being eaten by the shark.

The aesthetic for my controller will be two swimming flippers with buttons underneath them. The player will push down the flippers which make the buttons click. The idea is that each hand will be on a flipper. 
For an added feature the controller will have a shark on it with LEDs for eyes, which will start to glow when hes in a certain proximity to you.
